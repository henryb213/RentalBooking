## Access.

Never distribute the dataset. You must download and store it locally on a lab machine and not upload it to github. It should never be written to anywhere but the path: "/src/data/PC_Extract.csv". The .csv can be accessed via gitlab.

## Refine.

In the src/data/sanitise.py path is a python script written to sift through the PC_Extract.csv and select records of group F. These will be the only records we're required to analyse types for to influence our product's suggestions etc.
